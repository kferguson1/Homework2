# Homework2

The objective was to create an interactive Portfolio site with three different pages Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio. The links to each page must work and we must use a grid system. 

In order to do this I created 3 different HTML documents for each page. 

Inserted a Bootstrap Nav Bar for all three pages

Inserted a Bootstrap Contact Form

I added a Style.Css document in order to add style to the pages and make them more pleasurable to look at

Added Headers to make each page header/Nav look uniform 

Edited the Bootstrap contact form to include a message section and replaced the default placeholder text with “Jane Doe, Jane.Doe@gmail.com, I would like to request a quote”

For the portfolio page I added google images and alternate text 

I placed the images in the same row but two separate columns 

Mobile Navbar non responsive -> Added Javascript Bootstrap link to fix problem (Unsucessful)

Used Validation Software to validate HTML code; Error with Bootstap Code; 5 Warnings detected
